# The "Speak to Me" Closed License
An experimental, custom license designed to incentivize communication and collaboration.

# Rationale
I have become interested in writing my own custom experimental license for most new software I write for side-projects. The basic idea of the license is to require any person interested in the software (e.g., having read about it on social media, or in descriptions on GitHub, or via references on the Apache server) to contact me (or any other major contributor to the software) on a one-on-one basis, by email or in real life, in order to be eligible to receive the binaries and/or the source code. Notice, therefore, that it will **not** be an open-source license. I could expound on my reasons for making this decision, but suffice it to say, I've discovered a new priority for my personal software development: since I have developed so much software over the years, it is no longer necessary, nor desirable, for me to share the fruits of my labor freely and openly under the GPL, without a second thought, so that strangers may install the software and peruse the source code without my knowing. Rather, I am at the point in my life where it would be far more meaningful and desirable to incentivize back-and-forth discussion and collaboration as much as possible. I will work on this some more and post the new license here sooner or later. If you want any part of this (reviewing the license, catching loopholes, etc.), then... you know what to do.
